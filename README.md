### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working in the [Argelander-Institut fÃ¼r Astronomie ](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en/institute) as a PhD researcher ðŸ”­.
My work is primarly focus in processing astronomical images, simulate them, and creating algorithms to generate science-ready catalogs, which are used to study the large scale of the universe. 

My work at the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/), the [Dark Enerygy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), and [LIneA](https://linea.org.br/) has involved the use of sumpercomputers to process hundreds terabytes of data, as well as the development of machine learning and statistical tools to provide fast and accurate measurements.

I am looking to collaborate with researchers in ML who are working towards the adoption of AI in science.
